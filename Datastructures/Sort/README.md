# Sorting Algorithms

This project explores the implementation of various sorting algorithms, focusing on their efficiency, use cases, and practical applications in computer science.

## Features

- Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Selection Sort: A sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list and swaps it with the first element.
- Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.
- Merge Sort Variants:
  - 3-Way Merge Sort: A variant of merge sort that divides the array into three parts instead of two.
  - Bottom-Up Merge Sort: An iterative version of merge sort that avoids recursion.
- Quick Sort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the list into smaller sublists.
- Quick Sort Variants:
  - Quick Sort 1: A basic implementation of quick sort.
  - Quick Sort 2: An optimized version of quick sort with better pivot selection.
  - Quick Sort 3: A variant that uses a different partitioning scheme.
  - Quick Sort 4: Another variant with specific optimizations.
- Radix Sort:
  - Radix Sort 1: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that processes digits individually.
  - Radix Sort 2: A variant of radix sort with different digit processing.
- Counting Sort: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each element.
- Bucket Sort: A sorting algorithm that distributes elements into buckets and sorts them individually.
- Binary Sort: A sorting algorithm that uses binary search to place elements in their correct position.
- Binary Sort Variants:
  - Recursive Binary Sort: A recursive implementation of binary sort.
- Selection Sort Variants:
  - Recursive Selection Sort: A recursive implementation of selection sort.
- Insertion Sort Variants:
  - Recursive Insertion Sort: A recursive implementation of insertion sort.

## What I Learned

- Algorithm Efficiency: Understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms (e.g., O(nÂ²) for bubble sort and selection sort, O(n log n) for merge sort and quick sort).
- Divide and Conquer: Applying divide-and-conquer strategies in sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.
- Practical Applications: How sorting algorithms are used in real-world scenarios, such as data organization, searching, and optimization.
- Implementation Techniques: Writing clean and efficient Python code for various sorting problems.

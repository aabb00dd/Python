# Tree Data Structures

This project explores tree data structures, focusing on their implementation, traversal methods, and practical applications in computer science. Trees are hierarchical data structures that are widely used in various domains, including databases, file systems, and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Implementation of a binary search tree with operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.
  - Analysis of time complexity for different operations.
  - Use cases in searching and sorting algorithms.

- **AVL Tree**:
  - Implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree.
  - Rotations (left, right, left-right, right-left) to maintain balance.
  - Ensures O(log n) time complexity for insertion and deletion.

- **Tree Traversal Methods**:
  - In-order traversal: Visits nodes in ascending order for BST.
  - Pre-order traversal: Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
  - Post-order traversal: Used for deleting or freeing nodes.
  - Level-order traversal: Breadth-first traversal of the tree.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Visualization of tree structures for better understanding.
  - Implementation of utility functions like height calculation and node counting.

  - Differentiating between various types of trees (e.g., binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees).

- **Balancing Techniques**:
  - Importance of balancing in trees to ensure efficient operations.
  - Implementation of rotations to maintain balance in AVL trees.

- **Traversal Algorithms**:
  - Mastery of different traversal techniques and their applications.
  - Insights into how traversal methods are used in real-world scenarios, such as expression evaluation and hierarchical data processing.

- **Practical Applications**:
  - Use of trees in database indexing, file systems, and network routing.
  - Application of tree structures in solving complex problems like Huffman encoding and decision trees.

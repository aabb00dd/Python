# Abstract Data Types Implementation

This project explores the implementation of various abstract data types (ADTs) such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and hash tables. These implementations demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts and their operations.

## Features

- Circular Queue implementation with efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.
- Hash Table with dynamic resizing and collision handling.
- Singly Linked List for sequential data storage.
- Stack implemented using both arrays and linked lists.
- Queue implemented using linked lists and two stacks.

## What I Learned

- Understanding and implementing core abstract data types.
- Handling edge cases in data structure operations.
- Designing efficient algorithms for dynamic resizing and collision resolution.
- Exploring different ways to implement the same data structure (e.g., stack and queue).
- Gaining insights into the trade-offs between different data structure designs.

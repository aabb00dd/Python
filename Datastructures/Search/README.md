## Features

- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists by dividing the search space in half.
- **Recursive Implementations**: Recursive versions of both linear and binary search algorithms.

## What I Learned

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Understanding the time complexity of search algorithms (e.g., O(n) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search).
- **Recursive Thinking**: Implementing recursive solutions for search problems.
- **Practical Applications**: How search algorithms are used in real-world scenarios, such as database queries and searching in sorted datasets.
- **Implementation Techniques**: Writing clean and efficient Python code for algorithmic problems.

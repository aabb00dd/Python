## Features

- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**:
  - Implementation of stacks with operations like push, pop, and peek.
  - Implementation of queues, including linear and circular queues, with enqueue and dequeue operations.
  - Implementation of linked lists (singly and doubly linked) for dynamic memory allocation.

- **Advanced Data Structures**:
  - Hash Tables:
    - Implementation of hash tables with collision resolution techniques like chaining.
    - Use cases in fast data retrieval and dictionary-like operations.
  - Circular Queues:
    - Efficient use of memory by reusing empty spaces in the queue.
    - Applications in buffering and scheduling tasks.

- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Time complexity analysis of operations for each data structure.
  - Space complexity considerations and memory optimization techniques.
  - Comparison of different data structures for specific use cases.

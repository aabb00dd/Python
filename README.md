# Python School Projects

This repository contains several Python projects developed as part of my coursework in artificial intelligence, data analysis, software testing, machine learning, robotics, and data structures. Each project is designed to focus on a specific area of computer science and software engineering.

## About the Projects

The purpose of these Python projects was to explore and apply fundamental and advanced concepts across multiple domains, including:

- Building AI applications using search algorithms, heuristics, and basic decision-making
- Performing data analysis and visualization using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib
- Implementing and evaluating machine learning models with scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- Writing unit and integration tests using frameworks like `unittest` and `pytest`
- Programming and controlling LEGO EV3 robots using Python-based APIs for hands-on robotics experience
- Developing classic and advanced data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps) from scratch in Python
- Applying computational thinking, algorithms, and structured programming in real-world problem solving

Each project targets a specific topic covered during coursework, offering practical experience with Python programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving in various technical domains.

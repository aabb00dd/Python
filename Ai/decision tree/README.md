# Decision Tree Classifier Menu Program

This Python project is a terminal-based menu application that allows users to interact with a dataset and perform decision tree classification using the **scikit-learn** library. The program allows users to load a CSV, add data manually, build a decision tree, input new observations, classify test data, and more â€” all through a guided menu system.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
- Decision Tree construction and evaluation
- Genetic Algorithms and evolutionary strategies
- Heuristic search (A*)
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Visualization with `matplotlib`
- Memory usage analysis with `tracemalloc`
- Clean code and modular Python scripting

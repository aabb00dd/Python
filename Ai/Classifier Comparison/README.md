# ML Classifier Comparison Project (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest)

This Python project allows users to read a CSV dataset (e.g., Titanic), preprocess it, and evaluate three machine learning models:

- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-   Random Forest

Each model outputs standard classification metrics: **Recall**, **Accuracy**, and **Precision**.

## What I Learned

Working on this project deepened my understanding of both machine learning and real-world data preprocessing.

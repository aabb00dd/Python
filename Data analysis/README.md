# School Data Analysis Project

This project is a school assignment focused on applying data analysis techniques using Python. It involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a real-world dataset to draw meaningful insights.

## Features

- Loads and processes structured data using `pandas`
- Cleans and prepares the dataset (removing NaNs, duplicates, and outliers)
- Computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Performs correlation and trend analysis
- Visualizes data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Applies basic statistical tests and regression models
- Summarizes key insights and patterns from the data

## What I Learned

- How to work with data in Python using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
- The importance of data cleaning and preprocessing
- How to identify trends and relationships through visualization
- Basics of statistical analysis and model fitting
- How to interpret data and communicate results clearly

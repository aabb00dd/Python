## Features

- Load and clean COVID-19 case data
- Analyze total confirmed, recovered, and death cases by country
- Plot trends over time
- Compare multiple countriesâ€™ case curves
- Highlight significant spikes or patterns
- Basic statistical summaries (e.g., max cases, averages)

## What I Learned

- How to clean and preprocess real-world COVID-19 data using `pandas`
- Using group-by and aggregation functions to summarize time-series data
- Creating effective line plots, bar charts, and trend comparisons with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Identifying data patterns and drawing conclusions from visual trends
- Practicing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in a structured way
- Improving data storytelling with labeled, well-styled plots

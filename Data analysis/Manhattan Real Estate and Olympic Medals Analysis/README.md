  - Analyzes the correlation between sales price and gross square feet.
  - Handles data cleaning (removing duplicates, NaNs, and outliers).

- **Olympic Dataset Analysis:**
  - Investigates the correlation between population size and medal counts.
  - Visualizes data using scatter plots and regression models.
  - Discusses the effect of outliers (e.g., China and India) on correlation.

## What I Learned

- How to clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- How to compute and interpret correlation coefficients.
- The importance of handling outliers in regression analysis.
- Effective use of visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib for EDA.

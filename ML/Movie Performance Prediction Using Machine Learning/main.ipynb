    "Evaluation of non-NLTK models across three prediction tasks reveals striking performance patterns. Multinomial Naive Bayes demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness, achieving top accuracy for both revenue (77.93%) and profitable (83.18%) predictions while requiring only ~0.003 seconds of training time—approximately 30× faster than XGBoost. For vote average prediction, XGBoost slightly outperforms with 52.26% accuracy versus Naive Bayes' 51.98%, though this remains the most challenging prediction task overall. The consistency of Multinomial NB is particularly noteworthy, with extremely low standard deviations across folds (0.00006 for both revenue and profitable predictions).\n",

    "The results highlight a compelling performance-efficiency tradeoff among our models. While KNN consistently ranks last in accuracy across all tasks, it surprisingly achieves the best F1 scores for revenue (68.93%) and profitable predictions (75.60%), indicating better handling of class imbalance. The significantly higher accuracy for profitable prediction (83%) compared to vote average prediction (52%) suggests that financial success is more predictable from textual data than quality ratings. These findings point to Multinomial Naive Bayes as the optimal model choice when considering both performance and computational efficiency, especially for revenue and profitable predictions where it delivers superior accuracy with minimal computational overhead."

    "Based on the comprehensive statistical analysis across three prediction targets (vote_average, revenue, and profitable), the One Hot No NLTK approach with XGBoost consistently emerges as the best performing method, achieving top accuracy and F1 scores in all cases. However, it's important to note that despite these performance differences, the Friedman tests and pairwise comparisons reveal no statistically significant differences between the top-performing approaches (p-values > 0.05 in most comparisons and critical difference thresholds not being exceeded). This suggests that while One Hot No NLTK with XGBoost performs numerically better, the improvement may not be statistically reliable enough to definitively claim superiority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding model architecture choices, XGBoost consistently outperforms both Random Forest and KNN across all feature representations, with KNN consistently yielding the lowest performance. The analysis also indicates that simpler one-hot encoding approaches generally outperform more complex feature-engineered alternatives, suggesting that the additional preprocessing complexity does not meaningfully contribute to predictive power. Most notably, the NLTK processing did not provide statistically significant benefits, with non-NLTK approaches often performing equally well or better, indicating that the additional computational overhead of linguistic preprocessing may not be justified for these particular prediction tasks."

    "Results consistently show that simpler representations (One Hot No NLTK) outperform more complex ones. This suggests your models might actually perform better with a simpler feature set that avoids the noise introduced by additional processing, even if those features seem predictive in isolation. Its worth noting though that though the one hot encoded approach is simpler in implementation, it is more compute intensive due to a greatly increased dimensionality.\n",

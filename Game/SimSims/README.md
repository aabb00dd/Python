## Features

- Abstract classes for resources, places, and transitions.
- Simulates worker actions like resting, producing, and gathering resources.
- Manages resource flow between places like Barracks, Barns, and Warehouses.

## What I Learned

- Implementing abstract base classes and inheritance in Python.
- Designing a simulation system with interconnected entities.
- Managing resource flow and state transitions in a virtual environment.
